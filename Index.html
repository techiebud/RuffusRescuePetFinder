              <p class="">Ruffus Rescue is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) organization established to help reduce the needless euthanasia of adoptable dogs
                in north Georgia. Most of our dogs come from rural animal control shelters. They receive vaccinations, spay/neuter, heartworm/parasite
                testing and treatment, microchip, and other veterinary services, as needed, and we care for the dogs as our own until loving,
                permanent homes can be found. Ruffus Rescue receives no government funding and we rely solely on your financial and volunteer
                support.</p>

We've now been doing allergy injections for several months, and his itching and redness have nearly gone away. I'm very thankful to the veterinarians and staff at Wisdom for the excellent care Tonto received, and for nipping his allergies in the bud, so to speak.</span>

            <span class="more">and urinating excessively, we brought her to see the specialists at Wisdom. After running a blood test, Dr. Winthrop confirmed what we all feared - Samantha was showing signs of diabetes. The doctor put us on a daily routine to provide Samantha insulin injections, and showed us how to administer the shots. We weren't sure we could do it, but the gang at Wisdom was very supportive and encouraging. Now, two years later, Samantha is still free from any complications of diabetes, and her blood sugar regularly tests normal. Thank you, Wisdom Pet Medicine!</span>

            <span class="more">Golden Retriever, Roxie, started going into sudden kidney failure. They stabilized her and provided fluids until her kidneys were again functioning normally, but it was still a mystery as to what caused her health to decline so quickly. The vet noted our address on Roxie's chart, and asked if we lived on one of the orchards in the vicinity, and if Roxie had a habit of eating grapes off the vine. Our answer was "of course – she's a Retriever." That day we learned just how toxic grapes and raisins are to pets, and Roxie is no longer allowed to roam unattended in the orchard.</span>

When our 13-year old Comet goldfish, McAllister, turned from silvery white to an angry red, we called around, urgently trying to find a veterinarian who could help. Wisdom not only got us in the same day, but also was able to diagnose McAllister as having a severe case of septicemia. In order to kill the harmful bacteria in his blood, we had to use a dog antibiotic in his tank every day for a week, and in the end, McAllister was good as new. I still smile upon remembering Dr. Chase pulling out an old vet school textbook to calculate the correct antibiotic dose for a fish!</span>
